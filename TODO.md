# Locroot TODO

## Gaps vs. PROJECT.md
- Add application menu and/or system tray management in the Electron main process to align with the architecture requirements. 【F:PROJECT.md†L30-L35】
- Expose the planned `lang:sync` IPC channel for the later language synchronization flow. 【F:PROJECT.md†L55-L70】
- Provide editable inputs for file extensions and ignore patterns on the Project Setup screen instead of relying on hard-coded defaults. 【F:PROJECT.md†L172-L189】
- Expand the scan results table to show status (new/existing) and line numbers as specified. 【F:PROJECT.md†L195-L211】
- Prevent overwriting existing keys and surface possibly obsolete keys within the UI rather than only counting them. 【F:PROJECT.md†L120-L149】
- Implement the later Language Sync screen with per-language stats and sync controls. 【F:PROJECT.md†L224-L259】
